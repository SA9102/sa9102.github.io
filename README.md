# Portfolio

My personal portfolio describing who I am, my skills, projects.

## Development

- Fully responsive: I designed this portfolio using a mobile-first approach, then scaled the design up for larger screens.
- No template was used - I built this portfolio from scratch using React and Vite as the build tool. Apart from the drawer, all CSS is my own.
- Files are neatly structured into their appropriate folders

My primary focus is on the JavaScript/algorithms/coding side and not on design, and in my projects I mostly use component libraries like MUI and Mantine.

However, for my portfolio, I decided to write the CSS on my own in order to make it more personal. Although using a template would make it look more polished, the idea of looking at my portfolio and saying that "I came up with these designs" is something I value more, because it is something I have done and I feel proud about it.
