# :desktop_computer: Portfolio

My personal portfolio as a second-year undergraduate at Queen Mary University of London, studying Computer Science. It showcases my **skills**, **experiences** and **projects**.

## Development

- Fully responsive: I designed this portfolio using a mobile-first approach, then scaled the design up for larger screens.
- No template was used - I built this portfolio from scratch using React and Vite as the build tool. Apart from the drawer, all CSS is my own.
- Files are neatly structured into their appropriate folders

Unlike my other projects, I decided to write the CSS on my own instead of using a template or component library, as this gives my portfolio a more personal feel.
