    helped me to grow not just professionally at Superdrug, but also in my personal
    development. For example, after not properly greeting customers at the door, my manager has given
    me feedback on this and showed me how to properly greet customers (e.g. offering them
    a basket). Learning from this, I now greet customers properly and professionally, which
    provides a positive shopping experience for customers, and also deters any potential shoplifters.`,

        design choices I've made in previous projects, such as repeated logic and
        spaghetti code. Knowing that
        this is an issue when it comes to scaling and reusability, I now

        separating the logic from the UI, using global state management where appropriate,
